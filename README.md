# Eric's configs
*different portable configs stored in the cloud*

# Dotfiles

## Install
Add `source .bash_aliases` wherever your config file is first loaded (`.bashrc`or `.bash_profile`)  
Additional config files should be sourced from there.

# VS Code configs

## Snippets
VS Code allows one JSON per language and/or one global snippet file.  
For now we're using the global file and are setting scope to specific language for the main reason that I only use a handful of snippets so it seems silly to have many files.

### Importing
Snippet file should be moved to `.../Code/User/snippets/`.
> For BNC Windows install the full path was : `C:\Users\FONE003\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\global.code-snippets`

For a refresher on snippets see [the user guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)
